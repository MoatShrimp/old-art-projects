	<div class="main"><h1>Dreamy forest</h1>
		<p>You walk till you arrive at a meadow. The meadow is thick with soft grass and the sun is low so you decide to lay down and sleep...</p>
		<p><b>And then you wake up.</b><br>
		Having woken up before your alarm, you feel relaxed but you notice the hour and in the end, you decide to go back to sleep.</p>

		<p><b>The End</b> (Ending 6/7)</p>
