	<div class="main"><h1>Dreamy forest</h1>
		<p>Curious, you decide to enter the woods and after just a few seconds of trekking, you stumble upon a well used path to follow.</p>
		<p>Following this trail, you arrive at a fork. The path to your left at this fork is utterly covered in acorns and the one to your right is blocked by a deer.</p>

		<p>Do you wish to <a href="42.html">walk along the acorn road</a>?<br>
		Ask the deer for <a href="11.html">permission to pass</a>?<br>
		Simply <a href="90.html">walk pass</a> the deer?<br>
		Or <a href="50.html">attack it</a> with your sword?</p>
