		<p>You start running, but it feels like your running in jelly. You try and try to run but it's almost like you're standing still. You start to panic, knowing fully well that something might be behind you right now and like summoned, you hear something.</p>
		<p>You hear it closing in and you can almost smell its foul breath when its hairy paw brushes your leg...</p>

		<p><b>And you wake up.</b><br>
		Relieved to be able to move again, you check the time, realize that its long till morning and you decide to <a href="index.html">go back to sleep</a>.</p>
		
		<p><b>The End</b> (Ending 6/7)</p>
