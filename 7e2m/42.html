		<p>The acorns are a bit round and you're having a hard time keeping your balance. You try to stay on your feet while walking along but after a few seconds you finally fall and hit a patch of the acorns hard.</p>
		<p>But to your surprise, this in turn uncovers what looks like a face made of stone. Its eyes are closed and its mouth is ajar.</p>

		<p>Will you try <a href="55.html">placing one of the acorns in its mouth</a>?<br>
		Try <a href="29.html">asking it a question</a>?<br>
		Or just <a href="27.html">pass it by</a>?</p>
