		<p>You find the idea of abandoning this long and useless path a good one and you also think that a little exploration shouldn't hurt.</p>
		
		<p>Trekking through rougher parts of the woods prove to be no major problem but you haven't gone very far before you hear something to the right. Curios about what animal might have made the sound, you try to look, but you see nothing but trees.</p>

		<p>Will you <a href="84.html">go and search</a> for what made the sound?<br>
		Or will you <a href="100.html">continue walking onwards</a>?</p>
