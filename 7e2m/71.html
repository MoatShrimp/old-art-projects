		<p>In a panic, you run as quickly as you can to school and start looking for your teacher. You run around in a flurry, looking through every room you can think of but the teacher is nowhere to be found!</p>
		<p>Just as your about open another door, you realize that you've might forgotten about something in your hurry and looking down, you realize that you're naked. You've been running around naked this whole time and everyone in the school has seen you.</p>
		
		<p><b>And then you wake up</b>, it was all dream.<br>
		Quite the obvious one you realize, now that you're awake. Calming down, you look at the time, and closing your eyes, you decide to <a href="index.html">go back to sleep</a>.</p>
		
		<p><b>The End</b> (Ending 4/7)</p>
