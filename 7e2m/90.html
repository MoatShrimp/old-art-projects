		<p>You walk past the deer, being wary to not anger it, but in the end nothing happens. Walking along this new path for a while, you feel calm, but then you realize that something seems to be wrong, You've been walking and walking but nothing seems to change. After a long time of wandering you feel that it's time to make a decision.</p>

		<p>Will you <a href="53.html">leave the path</a> to the left and go deeper into the woods?<br>
		Or will you <a href="39.html">start running</a> instead?</p>
