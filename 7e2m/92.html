		<p>Travelling onwards, you arrive at a big tree. Bigger than any you've ever seen before.</p>
		<p>Sleeping in its shadow is a red -and also frightenly big- fox. With its size being on the more scary side, you try to sneak past it but the fox awakens and binds you to the spot with two big golden eyes. It then starts to speak:</p>
		<p>"I'm the king of the forest and because of I am just that, all in the forest belongs to me. You have entered, and are now part of what's mine."</p>
		<p>You try to speak for yourself, but you're unable to make a sound.</p>
		<p>"I'm hungry and require a meal, you will suffice. But I'm a merciful king and will only eat the unworthy, so I will give a question for you to prove your worth. Do you know what the stone face replies when questioned?"</p>
